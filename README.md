# ARD2

The alpha-solenoid detector Version 2. 
Alpha-solenoids are tandems of alpha-helices ordered as domains with exceptional strentching
properties in the living world. 

This is the standalone version of my tool ARD2 published in Fournier et al. 2013 PLoS One. 
Online version is here http://cbdm-01.zdv.uni-mainz.de/~fournier/ard2/
but needs repair.
